      <h1>Types of Tennis Shots</h1>
      <hr />

      <h2 class="forehand">Forehand</h2>

      <p>
        This is the easiest and probably the first shot learned. The
        <a class="bold">forehand</a> is made by swinging the tennis racket
        across the body on the same side as the main hand which the racket is
        held. Most tennis players use a single hand to grip the racquet for the
        forehand, but some players use a two handed grip. Different players like
        to use different styles of grips when executing the forehand. Some
        popular forehand grips include the Western, the Eastern, and the
        Continental.

      <h2 class="backhand">Backhand</h2>
      <p>
        As the name implies this is the opposite of the forehand, it is made by
        swinging the racket away from the body on the opposite side to the
        strong hand. Many players use a single hand to execute the
        <a class="bold">backhand</a>, but there are also many players that use a
        two-handed backhand.

      <h2 class="serve">Serve</h2>
      <p>
        This a shot tennis players have no option to master, they have to be
        able to produce a serve to commence a point. The
        <a class="bold">serve</a> is hit from behind the baseline and on one
        side of the court into the service box diagonally from the server. The
        tennis player usually throws the ball in the air and hits the ball at
        it’s peak height in order to get the best angle possible. Many
        professional players can hit serves well over 100mph that are nearly
        impossible to return. When a serve is hit that the opposing player
        cannot hit, this is called an ace.

      <h2 class="volley">Volley</h2>
      <p>
        The <a class="bold">volley</a> is an aggressive shot that is normally
        produced to force the opponent back or to win a point. The shot is
        performed before the ball bounces and the idea is to return the ball
        before the opponent has time to adjust. The classic players master serve
        and volley, where a player will charge to the net and then volley the
        ball quickly back at their opponent. Another type of volley is the half
        volley where the ball is hit on the rise after the ball bounces.

      <h2 class="lob">The Lob</h2>
      <p>
        A shot that is a little harder to master as it depends on skill and
        quite a high degree of technique. <a class="bold">The lob</a> is a very
        high shot, it is usually played hit for two reasons. Firstly to hit the
        tennis ball just out of reach of an opponent that is at the net and
        secondly as a defensive measure to gain time to get back into position
        on the tennis court.

      <h2 class="dropshot">Drop Shot</h2>
      <p>
        The first trick shot we have encountered.
        <a class="bold">Drop shot</a> is used when the opponent is at the rear
        of the court or out of position. The tennis ball is hit softly and just
        over the net to try and get it to bounce twice before the opponent can
        reach the ball. These are the basic shots a player will regularly use in
        a game, there are many variations and other trick shots that can be
        adapted into a player’s overall game.
